            <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
            <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible
                <span>DOM</span>s, broken <span>CSS</span> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
            <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of
                folk like the <span>W3C</span>, <span>WaSP</span>, and the major browser creators.</p>
            <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to
                see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one
                with the web.</p>

                <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
                <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <span>CSS</span>. The Zen Garden aims to excite,
                    inspire, and
                    encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any
                    one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <span>HTML</span> remains the same, the only
                    thing that
                    has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.</p>
                <p>CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can
                    be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the
                    reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders
                    alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

            <article class="part">
                <h3>Participation</h3>
                <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong
                    <span>CSS</span> skills are
                    necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even <span>CSS</span> novices
                    can use them as
                    starting points. Please see the <a
                        href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/resources/"><span>CSS</span> Resource Guide</a> for
                    advanced tutorials and tips on working with
                    <span>CSS</span>.</p>
                <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <span>HTML</span>. This may seem
                    daunting at first
                    if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the
                    sample files as a guide.</p>
                <p>Download the sample <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/examples/index">HTML</a> and <a
                        href="http://www.csszengarden.com/examples/style.css">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once
                    you have completed your masterpiece
                    (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your <span>CSS</span> file to a web server
                    under your
                    control. Send us a link to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to
                    use it we will download it and place it on our server.</p>

                <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how
                    amazing <span>CSS</span> really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those
                    working on the web
                    today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all
                    look forward to.</p>

            <article class="require">
                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <span>CSS 1 & 2</span> usage.<span>CSS 3 & 4</span>
                    should be limited to
                    widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
                    functional, practical <span>CSS</span> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the
                    browsing
                    public. The only real requirement we have is that your <span>CSS</span> validates.
                </p>
                <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <span>CSS</span> by now.
                    When
                    sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due
                    to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile —
                    pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many
                    as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android
                    browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
                <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable
                    material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work.
                    We’re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
                <p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics
                    (with limited exceptions, see <a
                        href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/guidelines/">submission guidelines)</a>, but we
                    ask you release your <span>CSS</span> under a
                    Creative Commons license identical to the <a
                        href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">one on this site</a> so that others may
